lemony
======

A toy language built with re2c and lemon

Warning!
--------

Abandon all hope, all ye who enter these ... er ... this repository! This is a personal effort to learn re2c and lemon and, hopefully, build a fun little scripting language from it.

Maybe.

Possibly.

It might actually happen.

Notes
-----
This project was originally forked from tokuhirom/re2c-lemon-tutorial and I intended to leave it as a fork, but there's no reason why I would ever want to submit, or they want to accept, a pull request, so I decided to break that link and make it a seperate repo.
